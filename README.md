# Data Engineering Bootcamp (IGTI)

## Project 01 - enade
The Enade - Exame Nacional de Desempenho dos Estudantes (National Student Performance Exam) evaluates the performance of students of university courses.

In this project, there is the extraction of data from Enade 2019, which are available on the website [Microdados Inep](https://www.gov.br/inep/pt-br/acesso-a-informacao/dados-abertos/microdados/enade) in zip format.

Understanding the data you are working with is an important part of data engineering. So, an analysis of the data is made, such as the **Descriptive Statistics** of the fields using **describe()**, **filters using loc[]**, **groupings with groupby**, **aggregations like mean()** and **replacement of values using replace()**.
